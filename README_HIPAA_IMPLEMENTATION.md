# HIPAA-Compliant PostgreSQL Implementation

## üè• Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive, production-ready HIPAA-compliant PostgreSQL configuration for your NestJS Health-Chain API. It includes field-level encryption, comprehensive audit logging, and all necessary security measures required for handling Protected Health Information (PHI).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the automated setup script
./scripts/setup-hipaa.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
Follow the detailed guide in `HIPAA_SETUP.md`

## üìÅ What's Been Implemented

### Core Security Components

#### 1. **Database Configuration** (`src/config/database.config.ts`)
- SSL/TLS encrypted connections
- Connection pooling with security limits
- Row-level security (RLS) policies
- Automatic connection timeouts

#### 2. **Encryption Service** (`src/security/encryption.service.ts`)
- AES-256-GCM encryption for PHI data
- Separate encryption keys for different data types
- Field-level encryption with transparent decryption
- Secure key management and validation

#### 3. **Audit Logging System** (`src/audit/`)
- **AuditLog Entity**: Comprehensive audit trail structure
- **AuditService**: Complete logging service with PHI tracking
- Dual logging (database + file system)
- 7-year retention for HIPAA compliance
- Special PHI access tracking

#### 4. **HIPAA-Compliant Entity** (`src/medical-staff/entities/doctor-hipaa.entity.ts`)
- Field-level encryption for all PHI data
- Transparent encryption/decryption
- Data classification and sensitivity labeling
- Soft deletes for audit compliance

#### 5. **Database Migration** (`src/migrations/001-create-hipaa-tables.ts`)
- Creates audit_logs table with proper indexing
- Creates doctors_hipaa table with encrypted fields
- Enables PostgreSQL extensions (uuid-ossp, pgcrypto)
- Sets up Row-Level Security policies
